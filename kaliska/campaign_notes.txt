Setting: ~30 deg S, southern Catia, early summer


Groups:
- Xadgnian Empire -- military doing excursions into far southern Catia
- Cado Kan -- radical political faction in Catia, seeking to Unify it. They're extremely isolationalist and militant.


Events:
- Met and formed party at the Leeward Rest, a waystation inn.
- Fought goblins, of the Rotfang Brigade, pillagers and attackers of opportunity. They were hardy and quick to flee.
- Came across Alator the enchanted cart maker, an orc. Tells us of bandits ahead of us, 1 or 3 days ride. Also in red and gold, but likely not Xadgnian, instead like Cado Kan.
