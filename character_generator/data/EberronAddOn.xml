While the weapon is on your person, you have advantage on            initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 30 feet of you can't be surprised,            except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep.

The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet,            and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have            disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.        </text>        <text></text>        <text>Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the            weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you            would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength,            but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the            finesse property.        </text>        <text/>        <text>Proficiency: simple, javelin</text>        <text>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 213</text>        <text>Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron, Chapter 5</text>        <dmg1>1d6</dmg1>        <dmg2></dmg2>        <dmgType>P</dmgType>        <property>T</property>        <range>30/120</range>    </item>    <item>        <name>Armblade Lance</name>        <type>M</type>        <magic>1</magic>        <detail>common (requires attunement by a warforged)</detail>        <weight>6</weight>        <text>An armblade is a weapon designed to integrate with the forearm of a warforged.

While the weapon is on your person, you have advantage on            initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 30 feet of you can't be surprised,            except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. The weapon magically awakens you and            your companions within range if any of you are sleeping naturally when combat begins.        </text>        <text></text>        <text>Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two            weapons.        </text>        <text></text>        <text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the            ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet,            and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have            disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.        </text>        <text></text>        <text>Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the            weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you            would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength,            but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the            finesse property.        </text>        <text/>        <text>Proficiency: simple, light hammer</text>        <text>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 213</text>        <text>Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron, Chapter 5</text>        <dmg1>1d4</dmg1>        <dmg2></dmg2>        <dmgType>B</dmgType>        <property>L,T</property>        <range>20/60</range>    </item>    <item>        <name>Armblade Longsword</name>        <type>M</type>        <magic>1</magic>        <detail>common (requires attunement by a warforged)</detail>        <weight>3</weight>        <text>An armblade is a weapon designed to integrate with the forearm of a warforged.

An armblade isn&#8217;t inherently            considered to be a magic weapon for purposes of overcoming damage resistance. However, any sort of magical            melee weapon could be created as an armblade, so you could acquire a vicious armblade or a vorpal armblade.        </text>        <text></text>        <text>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you throw it, its normal            and long ranges both increase by 30 feet (included in range). and it deals one extra die of damage on a hit.            After you throw it and it hits or misses, it flies back to your hand immediately.        </text>        <text>Curse: This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you.

The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet,            and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have            disadvantage on the attack roll.

If the            weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you            would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength,            but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the            finesse property.        </text>        <text></text>        <text>Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands.

If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit            points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its            life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is            slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.        </text>        <text></text>        <text>Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</text>        <text/>        <text>Proficiency: martial, double-bladed scimitar</text>        <text>Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 183</text>        <text>Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron, Chapter 3</text>        <modifier category="bonus">melee attacks +2</modifier>        <modifier category="bonus">melee damage +2</modifier>        <dmg1>2d4</dmg1>        <dmg2></dmg2>        <dmgType>S</dmgType>        <property>M,2H</property>        <range></range>        <roll>1d4</roll>    </item>    <item>        <name>Vicious Double-Bladed Scimitar</name>        <type>M</type>        <magic>1</magic>        <detail>rare</detail>        <weight>6</weight>        <text>The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves.

One of the simple functions of a docent is to serve as a translator. All docents understand Common            and Giant, but a docent knows up to four additional languages. Elven and Draconic are common options. If a            docent knows less than six languages in total, it can add new languages to its repertoire after encountering            them.

These traits are under the control of the docent, and if you have a bad relationship with            your docent it may refuse to assist you&#8230; or simply lie about information that it obtains.

House Cannith created the first warforged thirty years ago. But            the docents come from the distant land of Xen&#8217;drik and appear to be thousands of years old. Were they            created to interface with some other form of construct? Or are the modern warforged a new interpretation of            an ancient design? The docents claim to have forgotten their creators&#8230; but this is a mystery waiting            to be unraveled. While all docents come from Xen&#8217;drik, some have been brought to Khorvaire by            explorers and it&#8217;s possible to encounter them in the Five Nations.        </text>        <text/>        <text>Source: Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron, Chapter 5</text>    </item>    <item>        <name>Eberron Dragonshard</name>        <type>W</type>        <magic>1</magic>        <weight></weight>        <text>Eberron dragonshards are found in shallow soil, and often encased in geode-like stone shells.

You have advantage on Wisdom                (Insight) and Wisdom (Perception) checks made to spot threats to your ward. In addition, when you are                within 5 feet of your ward, and that creature is the target of an attack that you can see, you can use                your reaction to swap places with your ward. When you do, you become the target of the attack.            </text>            <text></text>            <text>Source: Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron, Chapter 4</text>        </trait>        <trait>            <name>Languages</name>            <text>You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.
