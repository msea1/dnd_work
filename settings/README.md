GOLD SEA

## Creation
Taken from RGB photo. Rough steps taken

* load into GIMP
* duplicate layer
* select new layer
* select part of map to focus on
* crop *layer* to selection
* desaturate
* threshold into pure black/white
* touch up
* repeat, merging each layer down as desired, but always leaving an original layer intact on the bottom
* once complete, replace original layer with all-white bottom layer
* flatten
* export
* open in Inkscape
* trace bitmap, multiscans but much faster and cleaner to run with just b&w image


## Size
Roughly 1225 miles by 950 miles as depicted. Roughly equivalent to a square from Paris to Kiev and Copenhagen to Rome.

In the SVG:

* each pixel represents roughly 50 meters, or ~150 feet, or about 5 full movements of a standard character.
* it is 30 pixels to the mile; each mile is marked by light blue grid lines
* darker red grid lines mark 24-mile boxes, representing a full day's standard movement

The scale was chosed so that medeival fantasy city generator can be exported into it easily. Simply:

* generate a city
* export it as a svg
* open it in it's own file
* transform it down to ~25% of its exported size
* select-all, copy, and paste into the Gold Sea map

The scale is calibrated such that a Medium city should measure around 1 square mile inside the city walls. That is roughly akin to late middle ages / early ren europe city sizes.

## Research Notes
Estimated population, again based on late middle ages Europe = 30 million
Estimated urban population = 2 million (5%)
Estimated population density overall = 20/km^2

## City Sizes
Mega (ex Istanbul) -- Pop: 50K+, Size: 9 mi^2 [3x3]
Large (ex London) -- Pop: 20-50K, Size: 4 mi^2 [2x2]
Medium (ex Aachen) -- Pop: 05-20K, Size: 1 mi^2 [1x1]
Small (ex Castellation) -- Pop: 1-5k, Size: <1 mi^2
Village (N/A) -- Pop: 500-1,000, Size: dotted huts
