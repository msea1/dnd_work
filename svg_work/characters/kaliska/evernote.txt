OVERVIEW
Longtooth Shifter, Dueling Fighter, Vengeance Paladin, Watcher, Ulfaren Viper, early-30s in age, Lawful Neutral

Background a combo of City Watch and Urban Bounty Hunter. Takes Deception from BH; all else from CW; then swap a language for prof w/disguise kit

Nicknames: On the job, Red Fang -- in reference to her Viper caste and proclivity to get in fights, but that was more a nickname not used much to her face. To those close to and comfortable with her, she was sometimes called Talon, an in-joke from her youth. Her full name literally translates to little wolf, chasing deer, bringing the spirit of war

STR: 16, DEX: 10, CON: 14, INT: 12, WIS: 14, CHA: 12
Prof in: Perception, Intimidation (via race), Athletics, Insight (class), Deception, Investigation (background)

Plot points —> Wolf shifter father, Viper officer mother; mother exerts more influence and she inherits both mother’s vendetta and penchant for action; father’s influence and contacts gives her a slightly more studious path as well and she mellows a bit; she ends up professionally halfway between the two, working in internal intelligence services; she learns through her access that her grandmother’s unit was intentionally sacrificed for strategic reasons and her fury re-emerges; she finds first opportunity to contact her mother to share this info (disregarding protocol) but her mother goes missing and she’s only told / able to find out that she’s “on assignment” somewhere; sensing her turmoil, she gets re-assigned south away from Xadgnia; she goes, and finds nothing there but busy work. Finally, after much internal wrangling, decides "I'm not getting scooted out of the way" and goes awol; working a bit as a mercenary and learning to cross-apply her skills.

She's a revolutionary personality in a nation state somewhat akin to a Native American tribe. Sort of an amalgamation of Jon Snow, Sterling Archer, and a 1910s-era Soviet agitator. She’s not subtle.

Personality: quick to anger, aggressive, fierce, loyal, honorable, ambitious, smart but foolhardy, rash. 

TIBF:
* I don’t pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds. I face problems head-on. A simple, direct solution is the best path to success. I can stare down a hell hound without flinching.
* Honor, Loyalty, Knowledge, Health, Responsibility, Patriotism.
* I’ll never forget the crushing defeat my (grandmother's) company suffered or the enemies who dealt it. My honor is my life.
* My hatred of my enemies is blind, unreasoning, and unforgiving. Doesn't care a whit for approval unless by superiors. Money and freedom mean little.

Quirks: 
* finds comfort in tavern settings, where there’s less scrutiny, loose talk, amble gambling. She’s a risk taker for sure.
* Keeps a small alter to Tritheron (or Drew to suggest another), god of liberty and retribution, triskelion symbol 
    * ^^ closest thing to a secret that she keeps since it's sometimes viewed as subversive given the realm of liberty as well; though she doesn't view it as liberty from the state, per se
    * Tritheron is CG, and suspect of Lawful zealots, of which the Raven Queen is definitately (LN). K is NG and will develop into either LG or CG depending on the Ul/internal rift

Upbringing
Born and raised around the Eastern edges of Ul.

Key Family
Father -- Limmikin Dichali (lit: shifter who speaks a lot), Shifter, Wolf Caste, Eastern district leader of Raven Queen temple. Comes from long lineage of shifting Wolves claiming to trace heritage back to original Ul.
Mother -- Elyra Acadiov (lit: sitting still in paradise), Human, Viper Caste, soldier w/melee specialty
Siblings -- none
Mother's Mother -- Xenga Nikosi (lit: growling bear), Human, Viper Caste, Deceased

Limmikin travels regularly to the central authorities on matters of magic in the city. It is through Limmikin that she drew her knowledge of magic early on and is why the spells she specializes in are drawn more from the realm of necrotic side of things. 

However, Limmikin's work often involved multi-day trips. As a result, Kaliska's mother, Elyra, played a large role in her martial upbringing and passed on her maternal heritage during their personal training as opposed to the more regimented state history. 

Kaliska's grandmother, Xenga, was also a soldier and was killed during the Xadgnian/Ul conflict by the company led by Kierien Darkiron and, per rumors, by Darkiron himself in a back-handed, dishonorable way. Elyra was angered at the death, and quite peeved at what she perceived to be a lack of appropriate response from Ul in not chasing after the Xadgians in retaliation. Elyra passed these along to Kaliska.

Schooling
Her parents hoped Kaliska would be a good mix of her father’s intelligence and leadership, and her mother’s strength and skill; that she could have a high ceiling in Ul, especially with her inheriting his shifting traits. Unfortunately, due to his regular trips away, Kaliska's father made less of an early impression than did her mother Elyra, who at the time of Kaliska's early childhood was assigned training duty and it was felt that Kaliska could benefit from her direct tutelage. Unbeknownst to the state, this means that family vendetta is passed on.

Alas, when time came, she was deemed potentially too aggressive, too rash and prone to action over contemplation. Too much her mother’s daughter in disposition, especially when married to her father’s recessive lupine genes. She's very smart and was obedient, so although she had too much passion in her she still ended up marked as a Viper. This was a tad of a disappointment to her parents, but not to Kaliska - who defiantly preferred her methods of action first. Still, the Viper caste was of no small repute and she did have a leg up in her training thanks to her parents’ connections. 

Adulthood, Recent Events, Lead up to Adventure
Growing up, she's somewhat groomed for the intelligence/watch service and takes to it well with her loyalty and book and martial talents.

Working in internal intelligence services; she learns through her access that her grandmother’s unit was intentionally sacrificed for strategic reasons and her familial fury re-emerges. 

To that end she carries a massive grudge against Xadgnia and Kierien personally. She's somewhat consumed by a revenge motive and wants Ul to fight back, or at least for Xadgnia to suffer greatly. 

As such, is out of step with greater Ul politics in wanting Ul to not just maintain status quo. She finds the current Ul leaders a bit milquetoast, all of this from her mother's influence.

Basically something in her (recessive lupine genes?) has always been more angry and independent than perfectly fits with Ul's external status quo. She's still devout to the internal ideology

Oath: foreign Independence/soverignty (nameless hero), use the vengeance traits — disregard? Have it something intrinsic in her? Or she discovered the religion and that's what led her to the questioning of her place in Ul

Mom: not keen on revenge, I fear she's been betrayed just like grandmother. What is she actually doing? (TBD)

She tries to find the first opportunity to contact her mother to share this info (disregarding protocol) but her mother has gone missing and Kaliska cannot get a straight answer out of her superiors as to where or why, only told / able to find out that she’s “on assignment” somewhere. 

This leads her emotionally away from Ul. Her superiors sense her teetering a bit and send her south toward the Free Cities/Catia/wherever on tasks to keep her busy and away from Xadgnia. She gets sent south, goes, and finds nothing there but busy work. Finally, decides "I'm not getting scooted out of the way" and makes the wrenching decision to go AWOL, potentially tossing away a promising career in Ul. She doesn't want to. She's disillusioned with the current leaders in Ul, not the state itself.

Character Arc
Her short-term motivations are
* to find her mom to confront "what she knew and when she knew it"
* prolong the battle to weaken Xadgnia as much as possible either by force, supplying or fighting alongside Catia, or by infiltrating Xadgnia and reporting back intelligence. 
Long term goals are 
* personal revenge against Kierien and perhaps the entire Xadgnian state.
* Change in Ul leadership?
* Help Free cities get their own autonomy?
*  

Development
Character story arc along the lines of
* finding something to live for beyond her vendetta
* Finding a way back into Ul and then fitting into the structure there better
* coming to an understanding beyond the worldview inherited and colored by her mother's passions

SETTING
* The Xadgnian Empire is the oldest human civilization in the Gold Sea, though it is significantly predated by many other races. Xadnia traces its roots back to the very first humans to discover the shores of the Gold Sea and seek to claim dominion of it and the surrounding lands. Their fielty to ancient kings of far off lands long forgotten, The Xadgnians are militaristic, expansionist, and fiercely ambitious. It is expected that each citizen of the Xadgnian Empire, whether natural born or conquered people, live their lives for the glory and advancement of the Empire. As such, all citizens are considered a part of the Xadgnian Legions beginning on their 15th birthday and are expected to serve on active duty for at least 4 years by the time they see their 25th year. Even those incapable of holding a sword serve The Legions as engineers, scribes, clerks, quartermasters, and a host of other roles. Order and honor hold a chief place in Xadgnian society.  Deserters and oath breakers are reviled as less than human; cast out, branded, or summarily executed for their crime. As Xadgnia has expanded its boarders and brought more and more land under the Empire's control, full citizenship has been extended to each new town, city, nation, and people conquered by sword or by diplomacy. Slavery is strictly outlawed in Xadgnian lands as the Xadgnian ideal is of a world united under a single banner, not a tyrannical emperor ruling from afar. That said, the zealotry of many Xadgnian legionaries has seen more than a few atrocities committed in the name of grand unification. Because of this, the gradual expansion of Xadgnia's boarders is met with varied reactions ranging from desperate war against the Legions' advance to open-armed acceptance of the security and prosperity the empire brings with it.
* The land of the Second Sun, Catia enjoys a peaceful and scholarly existence afforded to them chiefly by their patron: an ancient gold dragon named Enkai. Today, the collection of villages and towns that make up Catia are united not by a government, banner, or  even national identity. Instead it is a spiritual devotion to the ideals of harmony, justice, and contemplation taught to them by Enkai himself. Catians welcome strangers to their lands, confident in the protection the dragon offers to them and regularly export highly sought after spices far and wide. Gracefully arched shrines, pagodas, and dragon gates adorn the roads, spice fields, and many monasteries of the Catian lands, each seeking to achieve self actualization and inner harmony in their own way. Enkai is rumored to walk among his chosen people, cherishing them as fiercely as any dragon does its precious treasure hoard. 
* Called barbarians by some, shamans by others, the Ulfaren, as they name themselves, live by one simple rule: survival of the fittest. Though certainly not savage and uncivilized, the nation of Ul, the youngest human nation, has rejected much of the technological advancements of the rest of the Gold Sea, instead choosing to live more harmoniously with the natural world and in accordance with its brutal laws. Ulfaren society is divided into six castes that reflect the legendary founders of Ul; a group of shapeshifters whose extraordinary prowess carried them to victory over an elder white wyrm in a battle to claim the lands that are now Ul. Each Ulfaren is assigned to their caste at a young age according to their abilities and physical prowess and is marked as such by ritual tattoos across their backs. Though these castes are rigid, upward mobility is possible for those who demonstrate ability beyond their station. The weak, lame, infirm, or unfit, however are mercilessly culled at birth. This overwhelming emphasis on physical strength and perfection has led the Ulfaren to, over generations, cultivate an exceptionally hardy bloodline. Though human, the average Ulfaren is powerfully built with most men standing over six feet tall. All Ulfaren, regardless of caste, regard one another as family and, as such live in a sort of pseudo-communist society where goods and resources belong to the community rather than the individual. Some speculate this habit was learned from the Greymount Dwarves who aided the fledgling Ulfaren nation in transforming the mountainous terrain of Ul into a habitable valley that could be secured by two great gates on the southern and north eastern boarders. These gates were built largely in response to attempts by the Xadgnian Empire to subjugate the Ulfaren people in the early generations of Ulfaren society. The gates remain open to travelers, though the Ulfaren are characteristically cautious of outsiders, preferring to keep to their own rather than deal with their neighboring human kingdoms. Some of the best diplomatic relations in Ul have been established with the Mei'lani Elves and the Greymount Dwarves.
    * Sparta meets Native America — simple, black/white, nature, raw, not imperial
        * Would be in touch with nature, death, strength, cunning,
        * In general, prefer action over subtly, tradition over innovation
    * Nature:  Obad-Hai (M, nature, NN), Beory (F, nature, NN)
    * Cunning/Death: RavenQ (F magic and death, knowledge, LN)
    * Strength: Kord (M, athletics, sport, CG)
    * Avoid: Tharizdun (M, CE, trickery and darkness), Nerull (M, death, NE) Hextor (M, war and discord, LE)
    * Castes — Stag (peasants), Bear (defenders), Viper (CIA, police, ‘problem-solvers’), Wolf (priestly, ruling), Raven (the disgraced), Casteless (untouchables, slaves, POWs, etc)

Revised bullet points
* Grandma’s sacrifice revealed
* Feel unsure about isolationism now; is there something more? Vengeance
* Put on case to profile and catch a dissident (a la Fitz and UNABOM)
* Part of a tritheron cult - they made some sense to me though, intellectual contagion

* What if she’ll be abandoned too? "If that’s what the state deems useful, so be it” am told. But now I’m not as indoctrinated.
* “To what end?” I think. Why sacrifice and not put a stop to xadgnia? We need more than to protect ourselves.
* Put on suspension and frustrated, I just leave

Kaliska stuff: collectivist, anger, action
Retcon or look to redo interaction with Alvera post-trick. Over the top anger at being deceived unwillingly risking myself. She said it was Tabaxi’s idea? Hear that? Won’t even stand up to her own
