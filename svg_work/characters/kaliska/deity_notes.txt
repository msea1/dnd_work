Trithereon's dogma is described as follows:

"All deserve life and the ability to choose their own place in the world, and those who would place others in shackles or control them with oppressive laws must be toppled. Train the common folk to defend themselves and their property should another wish to take their freedoms. If you are wronged, you have the right to exact vengeance yourself, especially if none will help you."[3]

Clergy and worshippers
Trithereon's clerics are rugged individualists, never afraid to question authority. Those in cities instruct commoners in self-defense and recruit like-minded rogues and rangers for the cause of individual liberty. Those in rural areas act as scouts or spies against despotic lords or murderous nonhumans. Both sorts keep close watch on Lawful religions lest they become too powerful. The Summoner's clerics travel far and wide in search of those in need of their help.[3]

Those who venerate Trithereon strive for liberty for themselves and others. His clerics work fervently to end tyrannical regimes or free those in slavery. Followers of Trithereon must often travel in secrecy to avoid harassment from those in positions of power. It is said by some that no ruler ever feels entirely secure when a shrine to Trithereon lies within his borders.[1]
