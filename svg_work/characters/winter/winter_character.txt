PERSONALITY
* T: I don’t talk about the thing that torments me; I’d rather not burden others with my curse.
    * I put no trust in divine beings nor religious zealotry.
    * I spend money freely and live life to the fullest, knowing that tomorrow I might die.
* I: I’ll stop the spirits that haunt me or die trying.
* B: A terrible guilt consumes me. I hope that I can find redemption through my actions.
* F: Knowledge driven, curious, impatient, distractible, social, and that sometimes gets the better of him
    * You can't help but pocket interesting objects you come across.
    * Things, even lives, are useless after they’ve exhausted their information for me
    * Somewhat indifferent to social interactions unless there’s self-interest
* (Voice: soft and upper midwestern)
* Remember to act: Motivation, emotional level, story.

SIDE QUESTS
* What to make of the Scarlet Brotherhood?
    * They know me by the name “Summer Sky"
    * Boasting a motto of: “Living legends, by blood and brother writ”, these red-clad adventurers under the sigil of a bleeding rose seek chiefly to advance the name and fame of themselves and their chapterhouse. The brotherhood counts among its members many of the Gold Sea’s leading braggarts, knaves, swashbucklers, minstrels, vagabonds, and adventurers. Once a name is penned (in blood, of course) to the Scarlet Book, their loyalty is to their own immortal legend first, and to the brotherhood second. 

TENSIONS
* Religious fanaticism vs intellectual inquiry
    * Discovery of a possibly 2nd piece/artifact casts a lot of doubt in Winter. What if the story is true?
* Other Tabaxi vs wanderlust
* Assassin skills, and the Monk’s force code vs Winter’s personal experience with violence

CHARACTER ARC

    * Possible end point: a Robin Hood/Indiana Jones/Buddhist Martial Monk hybrid.
* Gather remaining artifacts, discover use
* Resolve issue with The Risers
* Perhaps revenge against Timroq
* Return home

BACKGROUND OVERVIEW
* Originally the Tabaxi migrated from the far far west. Once on the Gold Sea continent, Winter's clan settled in a forested area somewhere in the west?? [GERI TO MAYBE HELP PIN THIS DOWN]
* Winter was born right during an eclipse (hence first part of name, second half referring to astrology planes) and comes from a family dominated by a religiously devout father (named Distant Fire (Fire), who led services in the clan village amongst those who followed The Radiants (see below). His father's influence was felt most strongly by Winter's younger brother (named  Light Storm (Light)) whom was starry-eyed at their father's presence. The rest of his immediate family includes his mother (Candle of the Dark (Candle)) and older sister (Defiant Rock in the River (River)) who were more areligious.
    * The religion worships Azuma, goddess of the sun. Services are usually held around sunrise or sunset depending on the denomination and piety. 
    * Radiants are a particularly zealot sect that believe that Azuma promises a lost homeland returned. That we tabaxi migrated east to follow her, and that answers lay further east. They have a group within the sect known as The Risers, who are travelers dedicated to bringing that prophecy to fruition by trying to increase Azuma’s power. The Risers are made up of white to light-yellow Tabaxi (w/ yellow eyes), always dressed in unhooded yellow clothes on which is a crest of their religion sect, a golden sun/eye combo, hovering above a mountain peak.
    * Winter’s father held services twice daily, sunrise and sunset. The sun obviously being a huge huge deal, Winter's birth and markings makes him stand out amongst the Radiant, and casts an omen over him as seen by his father.
* Winter's sister had a big effect on him growing up and helped shield him from his father's influence and tirades. But still, Winter is expected to be bad, and he grows into that expectation somewhat and ends up a touch rebellious; scruffy; a scamp about the clan - getting into trouble. During these, Winter has numerous run-ins with the clan's version of law enforcement, Golden Marble (Marble), who was so named for the bright golden color of his eyes.
* Winter's paternal uncle, Curious Link (Link), was much more similar temperamentally and intellectually to Winter. Alas, Link was a wanderer at heart and departed the clan during Winter's early childhood to roam the country. It would be nigh-on a decade before Winter would see him again.
* Link would return with no warning and definitely travel weary. He took a few days to recoup his life back in the clan, seeing old friends and family for brief periods of warm wishes and check ins. But said he’d recount some of his stories in a few days time once he had settled back in fully. During one of Winter’s visits, Link shows him an obsidian ring that he returned with. Winter is fascinated and it’s pretty, but appears unspectacular. Link tells Winter to keep quiet about it. But on a future visit, with Winter and father, they are walking in the forest and Winter lets slip about it accidentally. Father asks to see it, Link doesn’t want to show it, but has hand forced somewhat by Winter’s disclosure. The obsidian ring appears just as it did before, pretty and alluring but seemingly nothing more. But then, a partial eclipse begins. As the sunlight dims, and the moon takes over more of the disk; the ring flashes an almost…black…light.
* Winter's father instantly believes it part of the Artifact of Five Stones,  and demands it for services. The Five Stones are thought to hold some divine magical power — (this could be unique to Tabaxi/my storyline, or dovetail with one of the other’s quests) — and are definitely sought after by The Risers faction for something related to Azuma. Usually portrayed in books/sermons as something like this:
        * There are (actually) six in total - one for each color in the feline color spectrum (yellow, green, blue, red-ish, white, black). That fit together in order to do something powerful in order to “help merge arcane power with Azuma to bring light back to the world.” Whatever that actually means. It could be good?
* Winter never believed in those stories, and still doesn’t. But his Father is enraptured by it and keeps trying to pry or buy it away from Uncle Link, which Link refuses, somewhat amused by Fire’s insistence. 
* Exasperated, eventually Fire sends word out about it to religious contacts he has. An outpost of The Risers show up, seeking it. And directed to Link, end up roughing him up when he still refuses to turn it over or disclose its now hidden (Link was wary) location.
* Hearing news of this, Winter rushes to visit Link to check on him. During that visit, Fire shows up and reveals he sent for the Risers. The two get into an argument with Fire more and more insistent in obtaining the obsidian ring. Eventually, Fire begins to strike at Link. Winter - reflexively and without thinking of anything other than protecting his uncle - stabs his father. Fatally it turns out.
* Link is in despair. His brother is dead, by his nephew’s hand. Wounded as he is, and realizing now this obsessed group won't stop at anything, he wants the ring away from him, but not in the hands of such a group as the Risers. Winter also needs to leave now, for the murder of his father, even in quasi-self-defense, will not sit well in the clan. Winter’s acrimony with his father was well known and long-simmering. Given all that, Link divulges the bidding spot of the ring and tells Winter to take it and run.
* Winter now needed to keep a low profile. He drifted, slowly at first as this was his first prolonged period away from home. In his nascent paranoia he had a hard time keeping a steady life going. He was always looking over his shoulder and work was tough as a Tabaxi, especially such a dark-furred one as him, stood out. That eventually led him to a last resort. If legitimate work risked too much attention, then illegitimate work was the only answer he could rely on. Thereafter Winter fell back on his childhood antics of sneaking around and petty theft. 
* Like many a Tabaxi, money and “goods” hold little intrinsic meaning to Winter per se and thus he doesn’t have a moral compass around stealing. It simply does not register as a "bad thing" because he doesn't view the act as malicious. It wasn't taking something away from another but more like borrowing it while not in use. That's how it was back at the settlement anyways. And since that's a fairly common mindset amongst Tabaxi, it raised little more than a wryly-delivered lecture.
* But now instead of being employed to satisfy his curiousity and cure boredom, Winter's filching was now needed in order to secure enough coin to survive. He didn't feel great about that. It also meant more frequent moving around since his presense in one place for long enough could raise suspicion as to how he acquired his coin. It was after one of these moves that he ended up in [ROGUE GANG TOWN GOES HERE].
* While there, Winter got caught trying to snatch from the wrong person by happenstance. He was offered a choice, the loss of a hand or work for the would-be mark until his punishment debt was paid off. Winter chose work and thus became an associate is the term they use, indentured worker was Winter’s.
* The person was part of a group calling themselves the Timroq. Disciples of Boccob, the group operated in an area that was preternaturally lawful and good. Boccob followers they were, they were committed to their interpretation of "balance" and so took on petty crimes (as seen by the inhabitants) to push back the goodness. They were marginally tolerated because as part of their balancing act, they acted as security for the town, especially involving outsiders. Some shakedowns, impromptu tariffs and mild hostility helped keep the town insulated from outsiders who might do greater harm. In addition, the Timroq sought out arcane magic and information from these sources.
* Winter was put to work doing odd jobs near the bottom of the hierarchy, but rose moderately due to good, and improving, Rogue skills. His time with the group honed some of his sleight of hand and thievery proficiency. He never tried to make himself stand out though, preferring to keep his head down and a low profile as much as he could.
* He ended up working a lot with another associate, Sanni. Sanni was a female dwarf a few years younger than Winter and she eventually looked up to him, not just physically. Sanni had actually been sold into the group by her father to pay off his gambling debt and was rather green at skills useful to the Timroq. Winter helped teach her a bit, though stealth never quite become a strong suit for her.
* However it was on a larger job with more of the group that Winter ran into trouble. Escorting a contingent of interlopers out of town there was a scuffle and in the melee, Winter had his top partially torn. Unknown to him right away, the obsidian ring that he wore around his neck on a long chain was exposed. Others in the group saw it and remarked upon it, wanting to see it. Winter hastily and clumsily deferred and try to play it off as nothing. They dropped it for the moment, but Winter was unconvinced of their long-term interests.
* Feeling that he was now exposed, Winter took the next opportunity on a small mission to slip out. Unfortunately, he was out with Sanni and was supposed to have been on lookout for her. Winter just left. He doesn’t know how that impacted Sanni; Winter had kept her in the dark about everything to do with the ring. 
    * (Sanni is hurt by Winter’s leaving, and doesn’t understand why Winter fled at such a perilous time. She’s bitter but she doesn’t necessarily wish Winter harm. In fact, she may have contacts in the Hammers, or have escaped the gang, or have her contract ended, or they may cross paths on a job for an item Winter also seeks for himself or for the Brotherhood…)
* Winter goes back on the lam; back to doing what he was doing before Timroq. However, he feels exhausted by this by now. Plus he has further cause to keep wary all the time with another group potentially after him, though he somewhat doubts they’ll care too much so long as he stays far away from their area. Still, he’s tired of this life and wants something different.
* It’s then that Winter's thoughts drifted back to a story his uncle had told him after Link’s return but back before all the chaos blew up. Amongst his travels, Link had visited and spent time at a monastery — The Perch Atop the Emerald Dragon. A decent amount of time in fact as he had gotten stuck there over a winter’s season. It’s location high up in the mountains (WHICH ONES?) was immediately intriguing to Winter - a landscape and climate he couldn’t fully imagine. It turns out that neither could Link originally, hence his predicament when he traveled beyond where he should’ve given the time of year. 
* Luckily for Link, he came across this monk house and they gave him shelter. Originally it was just out of a monk’s outlook - Link figured. But eventually it morphed into a two-way exchange. For the monks were interested in hearing what tales Link could tell them. They were a secretive group. They had a vast library but it was filled with scrolls mostly dealing with ancient knowledge - their knowledge of current or recent events were more strained.
* It was in that library that Link discovered some (unconfirmed) references to a powerful arcane artifact that resembled the piece he had come across (Link hadn’t divulged where he came across that to Winter - always playfully deferring it to “a later story”). Link kept his thoughts to himself - and when the spring thaw finally reached the mountain passes, he made his farewells in good graces. His stories of that place were some of Winter's favorites after Link returned. And it was to there that Winter decided to head.
* Winter didn’t have directions per se, and their reclusive nature didn’t help matters when it came to figuring out how to reach them, but Winter had enough of a description of Link's journey to find the right area and from there lay low and absorb enough tavern talk to figure out how to make contact with one of the monk’s who sometimes came into the little towns at the base of the mountains to trade for basic provisions that they couldn’t furnish themselves on the mountain.
* Winter plied his time above board -- so as to not attract any more attention than a Tabaxi naturally does -- until he could make an encounter in the flesh with a visiting brother. Initially hesitant, he warmed when Winter made reference to his uncle. And it got him an invitation to join for a few nights. A few nights became a year. A year spent reading and training. 
* They were an ascetic group though, which  coincidentally works well for Winter because his proclivity to steal doesn’t get challenged there; there’s nothing much to take. They keep few things of value except scrolls. A curious aspect of their studies is that they were neither chaste — the monastery was not unisex — nor outrightly pacifistic. Indeed, their code on force was more like that violence is needed to maintain a just order. Because not all can wield it. And the truly just won’t.
* Winter had decently good stealth skills before, but what he picked up fro the monks was the patience to let that stealth be a greater asset. And also a boot-making technique they had picked up from some random elven passerby many years, decades? centuries? prior. Trying to hunt game in the snow required immensely controlled movement and the ability to make no sounds or vibrations amongst an environment covered in a crunching surface that transmitted footsteps like vibrations in a tuning fork. 
* Winter eventually comes across the same books in the library that Link did, ones with references and information regarding the possible validity of the Artifact. Eventually his curiosity got the better of Winter and he inquires to a brother about the books, their source, and his ring.
* It does not go well. They immediately call a general meeting and there they state that the ring must be destroyed. They were philosophical followers against arcane magic, finding it a disturbance of the pursuit of contemplation and a tampering of natural knowledge. In other words, Arcane magic is a shortcut, not a destination. They give Winter a night to decide. But Winter cannot abide destroying it until he feels that he understands it more. He decides to try and keep it hidden and lie. But his deception is no match for the masters and he’s rather easily forced to admit it. For his attempt, Winter is told he now much leave. It’s not entirely in bad graces — he isn’t kicked out right then and there — but they all agree his welcome is now strained. 
* Yet again to Winter, he feels that every time he tells someone, or the ring is found out somehow, that he loses his group and is forced to move on. He’s not 100% tortured by this; he’s still a Tabaxi who has a travel bug. But he’s starting to question the usefulness of his obstinance over keeping the ring. In addition, his personal morality is a bit in flux with the miss-mash of his upbringing, the Timroq, and the monastery all exerting different influences.
* One thing for certain though, at the first possible opportunity after leaving the Perch, Winter wants to find a reasonably decent facsimile of the ring and start carrying that on his necklace as a decoy. The real one he moves to a more secretive interior pocket of his leggings. Asking around, he’s told that there are fairly good gem makers in and around the Seven Hammers so he resolves to head there. Along the way he first must pass through Emissary's Cradle...
