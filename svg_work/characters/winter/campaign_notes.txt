My NPCs

She may have contacts in the Hammers, or have escaped the gang, or have her contract ended, or we may cross paths on a job for an item I also seek for myself or the Brotherhood...

PAUSE POINT
Just finished rescuing Clayton's brother, Davey. And Davey is much older than Clayton, like 10-12 years about. It appears that it wasn't Davey who taken by the fey, but Clayton - which also explains why Davey thought Clayton was dead!
