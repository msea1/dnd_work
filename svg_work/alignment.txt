LAWFUL
Having a strict sense of rules. Moral, Legal, whatever. They keep their word, whatever the motive.

LG - keeps promise b/c it's the right thing to do
LN - keeps promise b/c it is a promise
LE - keeps promise but in the strictest sense, and not in the principle sense


CHAOTIC
Don't give a fuck about integrity; but IT IS NOT random or inconsistent. Goes off feelings, personal freedom, instincts, adaptability. 

CG - Robin Hood
CN - cheats to help self
CE - lies for its own goals


GOOD
go out of way to do good, without needing a reward, and sometimes even to the benefactors ill (ie 'greater good')

EVIL
actively harm or ignoring consequences

Above not just concerned with motives, but also your actions. Means AND ends in other words. 


NEUTRAL
The ends (cross) are pure distilled forms of that trait. ie CN is pure chaos, NG is pure good


True Neutral -- enigma
